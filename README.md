a semantic way of vibing together!

# the idea

this is just an idea and look to find someone that could help get the project going or share any insights on how I can make it a reality as I am not an experienced dev

the idea is to create a system where anything can be connected with anything and I explain with some examples:

e.g.1: someone makes a post (any form):

there is a reaction system where you select any of the following:

a. this makes me feel: user inputs a text of what the video made them feel
b. this sounds like: user inputs how its sounds to them
c. this reminds me of: user inputs what it reminds them
d. this made me think of: user inputs what it made them think of

and so on

the reaction system in (1) can also include classic emojis or images or gifs or videos or audio or link to other posts or links etc

people can apply the reaction system to the reactions themselves and the pros and cons of the kialo like feature

when somone reacts with a post they are linked so people reading one post can automaticly populate through that connection the other post and its reactions

a way of combining posts and reactions and pros and cons so you can apply the reactions system and pros and cons to the combinations etc

the result: 

this could be the semantic way of unlimited interconnected information and media 

it could also be used to create an AI that is really efficient in understanding the world and the connections of information and how every single bit of information and media makes a person feel.

 this could lead to an AI that doesnt halucinate but can make a true analysis like scientists do and give answers that are valid and proven, and if there is no certain result then it can create its own theories that can be proven once more info is available or give statistical analysis or even create questions and tests for us to test and find the answer. Cause when a question doesnt have a definitive answer then you need to ask another better question.
